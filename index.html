                <summary>Q1.  What is a solar system?</summary>
         
                    <p>
                        Ans: A solar system is made up of a star (like our Sun) at the center, with planets, moons, asteroids, and comets orbiting around it, all held together by the star's gravitational pull. <br>

                <p>
                    Ans: A solar system is thought to form from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust, with the densest part becoming the star and the remaining material forming planets and other objects.<br>

                    <summary>Q5.  Why does the Moon change its shape daily?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Ans: The Moon changes its shape daily because of its phases, which result from its orbit around Earth. As it moves, different portions of its sunlit side become visible from Earth, creating the appearance of changing shapes, from new moon to full moon and back.<br>

                <p>
                    Ans: Meteors are not visible during the day because sunlight is too bright, overpowering the faint light emitted by meteors as they burn up in Earth's atmosphere.<br>

                <p>
                    Ans: We see the same side of the Moon because it is tidally locked to Earth. This means the Moon's rotation period matches its orbit around Earth, keeping one side always facing us.<br>

                <p>
                    Ans: No, stars emit light all the time, but we see them at night because the Sun's brightness during the day outshines their faint light.<br>

                    <summary>Q9.  Why do stars twinkle?</summary>
                <p>
                    Ans: Stars twinkle because their light passes through Earth's atmosphere, where it is bent and scattered by varying air densities, causing the light to appear to flicker.<br>

                <p>
                    Ans: The planetary group, or the solar system, is vast. It spans about 100,000 astronomical units (AU), with 1 AU being the distance between Earth and the Sun (about 150 million kilometers). This includes the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and the farthest edge of the Oort Cloud.<br>

                <p>
                    Ans: The different types of stars include:<br>
                    1. Main sequence stars – Like the Sun, they fuse hydrogen into helium. <br>
                    2. Red giants – Large, cool stars that have expanded after using up their hydrogen. <br>
                    3. White dwarfs – Dense, leftover cores of stars that have exhausted their fuel. <br>
                    4. Neutron stars – Extremely dense remnants of supernova explosions. <br>
                    5. Supergiants – Very large, bright stars, often nearing the end of their life cycle. <br>
                    6. Black holes – Not stars, but the result of massive stars collapsing under gravity.<br>
